## Description

A concierge system is a service-oriented platform designed to assist individuals with personal requests and tasks. It
typically operates within hospitality settings such as hotels, offering guests tailored information and services ranging
from travel arrangements to event bookings. The system is manned by concierges who are knowledgeable, resourceful, and
skilled in providing high-quality customer service. They act as liaisons, connecting clients with desired experiences
and conveniences. Advanced concierge systems may also incorporate digital solutions to enhance efficiency and
accessibility.

## Tools

- **Language**: [Java 17](https://jdk.java.net/): Java is the #1 programming language and development platform. It
  reduces costs, shortens development timeframes, drives innovation, and improves application services.
- **Build tool**: [Gradle](https://gradle.org/): From mobile apps to microservices, from small startups to big
  enterprises, Gradle helps teams build, automate and deliver better software, faster.
- **Libraries**:
    - [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): Project Lombok is a java library that automatically plugs into your editor
      and build tools, spicing up your java.
    - [Ebean](https://ebean.io/): Persistence for Java & Kotlin.
    - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/): SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained,
      high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
    - [Javalin](https://javalin.io/): A simple web framework for Java and Kotlin.
    - [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/): Logback is intended as a successor to the popular log4j project, picking up
      where log4j 1.x leaves off.
    - [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/): The standard Java libraries fail to
      provide enough methods for manipulation of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang provides these extra methods.
    - [Java Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker): This library is a port of Ruby's faker gem (as well as Perl's
      Data::Faker library) that generates fake data. It's useful when you're developing a new project and need some
      pretty data for showcase.
    - [Google Gson](https://github.com/google/gson): Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects
      into their JSON representation. It can also be used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object.
    - [gRPC](https://grpc.io/): A high performance, open source universal RPC framework.
    - [gPRC-java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java): gRPC-java is a modern open source high performance Remote
      Procedure Call (RPC) framework.
    - [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/): Protocol Buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible
      mechanisms for serializing structured data.
- **Gradle plugins**:
    - [Ebean Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/ebean-orm-tools/ebean-gradle-plugin): Plugin that performs Enhancement (
      entity, transactional, query bean) and can generate query beans from entity beans written in Kotlin via kapt.
    - [Gradle Versions Plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin): In the spirit of the Maven Versions
      Plugin, this plugin provides a task to determine which dependencies have updates. Additionally, the plugin checks
      for updates to Gradle itself.
    - [Protobuf Plugin for Gradle](https://github.com/google/protobuf-gradle-plugin): The Gradle plugin that compiles
      Protocol Buffer (aka. Protobuf) definition files (*.proto) in your project.
